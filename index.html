        Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept.
        <br /><br />
        When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this
        intentionally. You think: “I’m gonna need a variable here,” and add it
        to your code.<br /><br />
        Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they
        have already used them unknowingly many times — and it is likely that
        this is true for yourself, too. So learning closures is less about
        understanding a new concept and more about recognizing something you
        have already been doing for a while.

      <h2>tl;dr</h2>
      <p>
        You have a closure when
        <strong> a function accesses variables defined outside of it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice how user => user.startsWith(query) is itself a function. It uses
        the query variable. But the query variable is defined outside of that
        function. That’s a closure.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Functions Can Access Outside Variables</h2>
      <p>
        To understand closures, we need to be somewhat familiar with variables
        and functions.

      <p>
        But what if we wanted to later change the food variable outside of the
        eat function? To do this, we can move the food variable itself out of
        our function into the top level.
