        Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept. When you
        use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. You
        think: “I’m gonna need a variable here,” and add it to your code.
        Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they
        have already used them unknowingly many times — and it is likely that
        this is true for yourself, too. So learning closures is less about
        understanding a new concept and more about recognizing something you
        have already been doing for a while.
